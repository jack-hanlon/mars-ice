# Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify">This project studied GPU-based implementations of numerical linear algebra algorithms, with a particular focus on a prototype Monte Carlo algorithm to model Mars subsurface ice detection developed by the Canadian Space Agency(CSA). 
This model has already been implemented using a conventional CPU-based approach, but may benefit substantially from the parallelism of a GPU-based implementation. Domain specific expertise and guidance was provided by Dr. Etienne Boulais of the CSA. </div>

Unfortunately, the full code implementation must stay private as per the request of my supervisor at the Canadian Space Agency.
