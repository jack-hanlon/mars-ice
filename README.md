<h2>Using GPU Computing to model Mars subsurface ice detection with polarimetric synthetic aperture radar</h2>

This project will study GPU-based implementations of numerical linear algebra algorithms, with a particular focus on a prototype Monte Carlo algorithm to model Mars subsurface ice detection developed by the Canadian Space Agency(CSA). This model has already been implemented using a conventional CPU-based approach, but may benefit substantially from the parallelism of a GPU-based implementation. Domain specific expertise and guidance will be provided by Dr. Etienne Boulais of the CSA.

Unfortunately, the full code implementation must stay private as per the request of my supervisor at the Canadian Space Agency.
